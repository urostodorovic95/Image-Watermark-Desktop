# Image-Watermark-Desktop
A simple desktop image watermarking utility app.
Creates a composite of two images (a main image, and a desired watermark image). It is highly recommended to use a watermark image with a uniform background.

_Built on tkinter and pillow python libs. Dependencies can be installed from requirements.txt._

**Usage**
- Run the run.py file.
- Images must be selected in this order:
  1. Image containing the watermark (your logo, _etc._)
  2. Main image on which watermark will be placed.
- The screen automatically updates with a preview.
- A save button appears (saves to disk). If an extension is not provided in the file save dialogue, the original image format is used automatically.
